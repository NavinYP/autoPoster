A simple Discord bot written using discord.py which can be used to post random images from a image collection locally stored on your hard drive to a server.

This is the most basic version of the bot that I have written. And this bot has to be run locally on your computer to be used.

1. Download the files.
2. Create a .env file with the following attributes filled.

  DISCORD_TOKEN = [Your Discord token from the developer portal]
  FOLDER_PATH = [The local folder path you want to use] 
  
Use without '[]'. And the local folder path is the parent folder which has the subfolders.

This code will only work on Windows. You can edit out the Python code to do as you wish if you have basic Python knowledge.
